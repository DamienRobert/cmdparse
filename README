cmdparse - an advanced command line parser using optparse which has support for commands

Copyright (C) 2004 Thomas Leitner

= Description

Some new programs use a "command style" command line. Examples for such programs are the "svn"
program from Subversion and the "gem" program from Rubygems. The standard Ruby distribution has no
library to create programs that use such a command line interface.

This library, cmdparse, can be used to create such a command line interface. Internally it uses
optparse to parse options and it provides a nice API for specifying commands.


= Dependencies

 optparse - part of the standard Ruby 1.8 distribution, so nothing to do here


= Installation

 $ ruby setup.rb config
 $ ruby setup.rb setup
 $ ruby setup.rb install

Or you could use Rake and substitute the above commands with this:
 $ rake install

Or you could install cmdparse the "GEM way":
 $ gem install cmdparse


= Documentation

You can build the documentation by invoking
 $ rake doc

This builds the API and the additional documentation. The additional documentation needs webgen
>=0.3.2 (webgen.rubyforge.org) for building.


= Example

There is an example of how to use cmdparse in the +test.rb+ file.
