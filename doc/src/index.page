h2. Welcome

... to the homepage of _*CommandParser*_, an advanced command line parser.

Have a look around the site!

h2. News

*cmdparse 1.0.1 released!!!*

Changes:

* Improved HelpCommand: the global options -h and --help take an optional command name now
* Possibility to define a default command which is used when no command was specified
* A @NoCommandGivenError@ is thrown when no command on the CLI and no default command was specified

h2. Description

Some new programs use a "command style" command line. Examples for such programs are the "svn"
program from Subversion and the "gem" program from Rubygems. The standard Ruby distribution has no
library to create programs that use such a command line interface.

This library, cmdparse, can be used to create such a command line interface. Internally it uses
optparse to parse options and it provides a nice API for specifying commands.

h2. And so

... have fun!
