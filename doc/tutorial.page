## Tutorial

The complete code for this example can be found in the file `net.rb` of the `cmdparse` package!

This tutorial produces a small `net` application which can add, delete and list IP adresses and show
'network statistics'. The shown code fragments do not include the whole program. So, instead of
writing all the code yourself, just look at the code fragments first and then use the include
`net.rb` file for running the program.

### Require statements

Create a new new file and write the necessary `require` statements.

~~~ ruby
{extract: {lines: !ruby/range 5..5}}
~~~

### The `CommandParser` class

Next we will define our basic `CommandParser` by defining the name of the program, its version and
the global options.

The first boolean argument to the constructor of the `CommandParser` class defines whether
exceptions should be handled gracefully, i.e. by showing an appropriate error message and the help
screen. The second boolean argument defines whether the top level commands should use partial
command matching instead of full command matching. If partial command matching is used, then the
shortest unambiguous part of a command name can be used instead of always specifing the full command
name.

~~~ ruby
{extract: {lines: !ruby/range 30..36}}
~~~

The options are defined using an option parser wrapper. Currently, the only option parser library
supported is `optparse` from the Ruby Standard Library. If you want to use another option parser
library, you need to write a wrapper for it so that `cmdparse` can use it.

Now we only have to tell the program to use our newly defined class to process the command line
arguments.

~~~ ruby
{extract: {lines: !ruby/range 86..86}}
~~~

The `parse` method of our `CommandParser` instance parses the given array of options (or `ARGV` if
no argument is specified). All the command line options are parsed and the given command executed.

The program can be executed now but won't be useful as we did not specify any commands.


### Defining commands

So, as we have defined our `CommandParser` object, we need to add some commands to it. First, we
will add two predefined commands, namely the `help` and the `version` command.

~~~ ruby
{extract: {lines: !ruby/range 37..38}}
~~~

That was easy! Now you can execute the program and specify the commands `help` or `version`.
However, we want the program to do something "useful". Therefore we define a new command.

~~~ ruby
{extract: {lines: !ruby/range 41..44}}
~~~

This command is defined by using the default `Command` class. First an instance is created assigning
a name to the command and defining whether this command takes subcommands and uses partial command
matching. Next we add a short description so that the `help` command can produce something useful.
And at last, we add this command to our `CommandParser` instance.

We specified that our `ipaddr` command takes subcommands. So we have to define them, too:

~~~ ruby
{extract: {lines: !ruby/range 46..78}}
~~~

We add three subcommands to the `ipaddr` command: `add`, `del` and `list`.

* The `add` command is similar to the `ipaddr` command. However, as the `add` command does not take
  other commands, we have to define an execution block.

* The `del` command is similar to the `add` command. As we want to be able to delete all IP
  addresses by issuing only one command, we add an option for this.

* By providing `true` as second argument when we add the `list` command to the `ipaddr` command, we
  specifiy that this command should be the default command which gets invoked when no command name
  is specified on the command line. Only one command can be specified as default command!

Till now we only used the basic `Command` class to specify commands. However, new commands can also
be created by subclassing the `Command` class, as shown with this last command:

~~~ ruby
{extract: {lines: !ruby/range 9..28}}
{extract: {lines: !ruby/range 39..39}}
~~~


### Running the program

That's all! You can run the program now and have a look at the output which differs depending on
which arguments you choose.

So, a typical invocation of this program looks like this:

    $ ruby net.rb --verbose ipaddr add 192.168.0.1 193.150.0.1

* `--verbose` is a global option
* `ipaddr` is the first command name (which has no options)
* `add` is the second command name (which also has no options)
* `192.168.0.1 193.150.0.1` are additional arguments

You should notice that if you type

    $ ruby net.rb

you get an error because you did not specify any command.

However, when you type

    $ ruby net.rb ipaddr

you do not get an error!

Why? As the `ipaddr` command takes subcommands there should be an additional command name (e.g.
`list`) on the command line. However, as the `list` command is the default command for `ipaddr` you
do not need to type it.

*By the way:* You get the same output if you type

    $ ruby net.rb ip

Why? As partial command matching is used for the top level commands, the shortest unambiguous name
for a command can be used. As there is no other command starting with `ip` (or even with the letter
`i`), it is sufficient to write the above to select the `ipaddr` command.

*Notice:* The options of a command which does not take subcommands do not need to be at the front;
they can be anywhere, like this

    $ ruby test.rb --verbose mycommand file1 file2 --recursive file3
